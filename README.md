# Advent of Code 2022 - Elixir

Advent of Code 2022 puzzles written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)  
Written for learning purposes by a beginner, so the solutions are more than likely subpar

***

### Installing and running:

If you don't have Elixir installed, follow the [install guide](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) first  

Open a terminal and do the following:
1. Clone and enter the repo: `git clone https://github.com/leokempe/aoc-2022-elixir.git && cd aoc-2022-elixir`
2. Open Elixir's interactive shell: `iex -S mix`
3. To run a specific day's puzzle, use this command in the interactive shell: `Day{n}.part_{x}()` replacing `{n}` with the date and `{x}` with the part of the puzzle, e.g. `Day1.part_1()`, `Day24.part_2()`
